Version 0.12
------------

A few small bugfixes:

- the defaults file is now installed automatically; even though all
  settings are commented out, this allows for easier configuration
- require and check for a minimum device size; this makes error messages
  much clearer, compared to tar's out of disk space errors (fixes issue
  164)
- it is now possible to override the "components" argument to
  debootstrap, to be able to install more packages (e.g. from contrib,
  or from universe) (fixes issue 254)
- all existing hooks are now distributed in the archive and also
  installed via `make install' (fixes issue 283)
- the console activation for xen-pvm hypervisor has been corrected;
  before it was working only for kvm (fixes issue 284)


Version 0.11
------------

The partition alignment offset is now configurable (using the
PARTITION_ALIGNMENT configuration setting, in sectors) and the
distribution names and packages in the defaults file have been updated.

Furthermore, the grub example hook has been improved a bit:

- automatically uses the defined proxy, so that package installation
  uses the same method as the main install
- debconf frontend set to non-interactive, to prevent an debconf
  question loop

However, there still seem to be issues related to this hook (recent grub
versions fail to run correctly "grub-install" or "update-grub" and
complain about device mappings); help is welcome.

Version 0.10
------------

This add supports for ext4 file-systems and changes the default
distribution from Lenny to Squeeze.

Additionally, new hooks were added:

- setting the password for the root user
- setting the timezone
- setting SSH keys for a given user

Version 0.9
-----------

Changed the default CUSTOMIZE_DIR (under $sysconfdir, usually /etc) from
ganeti/instance-debootstrap.d to ganeti/instance-debootstrap/hooks, to
match better with the directory used for the variants file. Now
customization of the instance-debootstrap is done either in the defaults
file or under ganeti/instance-debootstrap.

Fix serial console access for kvm instances (bind to ttyS0 rather than
console). Please note that with this change if you toggle the serial
console hypervisor parameter in Ganeti, but don't create the getty entry
in /etc/inittab or /etc/event.d/ you won't have serial access. Before it
used to work, but the serial console was slightly broken (no ctrl+c for
example).

Also start shipping the examples in the tar archive, to ease packaging.

Version 0.8
-----------

Added support for OS API 15 (with OS variants) that is supported by
Ganeti 2.1.

blktype is now supported as an alternative to vol_id; this is needed for
newer Debian-based operating systems.

Added an example grub script, that can be used for automatically
installing grub inside new instances.

Version 0.7
-----------

Fix Ganeti 1.2 compatibility (0.6 was broken) and force the scripts to be
executed under /bin/bash (rather than /bin/sh). This fixes compatibility with
distributions where /bin/sh is not bash.

Support 'msdos' partition style, in which the instance disk gets a partition
table, and one big partition, rather than creating the filesytem directly on
the block device. This requires kpartx to be installed, and is the default when
installing under Ganeti 2.0.

Added the possibility to customize the installation without having to patch the
os directly, by executing the scripts in CUSTOMIZE_DIR and giving them a chance
to change the instance filesystem. As an example a script that sets the first
nic to request a dhcp address is provided.

Version 0.6
-----------

Support for Ganeti 2.0 (os api 10)

The instance's fstab is now generated with volumes' UUIDs rather than paths.
This makes it more resilient to changes and use under different
hypervisors/drivers.

Init is configured to listen on /dev/console rather than /dev/tty1

Version 0.5
-----------

Most of the settings of the script have been moved to a configuration
file.  Depending on the ./configure options, the location of this file
might be /etc/default/ganeti-instance-debootstrap or
/usr/local/etc/default/ganeti-instance-debootstrap.

The cache generation and cleaning variables can be modified as follows:

- to enable generating the cache, modify the config file and set
  GENERATE_CACHE to "yes"
- to disable cleaning the cache, set CLEAN_CACHE to ""; or
  alternatively, you can customize with this variable the number of days
  after which to clear the cache

Note that the cache file is no longer stored in the same directory as
the OS definition files, but (again depending on ./configure options)
usually under /var/cache/ganeti-instance-debootstrap.

There are many other customizable settings added in this version, for
example the actual OS to be installed (no longer always installing
Debian Etch), whether to use a proxy or not, etc. See the README and the
'defaults' files.

Version 0.4
-----------

This version fixes the problem of interface renaming at instance import
time, by removing the saved udev hotplug rules (if any).

Version 0.3
-----------

The OS will cache the image of the first instance it installs using the
name "cache-$arch.tar" (where $arch is what dpkg --print-architecture
returns) on a node-by-node basis. This cache will be then used on the
future installs, speeding them greatly (even with a fast mirror). Feel
free to remove the cache at any time, or to copy it to all nodes. The
cache will be kept for two weeks, after which the first install will
recreate the cache (in order not to use old packages). If you don't care
about package age, remove the user write permission (chmod u-w) from the
cache and ganeti will continue to use the same file without refreshing
it.

If you don't have enough space and don't want cache creation, just touch
the file 'no_cache' - this will prevent the creation, but the script
will continue to use a cache if it exists (but it will remove an
existing one after two weeks).

Also note that if the image file is there, the script does not need
network access at all.
